                    <br> <br>
                Waves. Crashing waves. Calming waves. Cathartic waves wash over my thoughts every time I dig my toes in the damp sand. I become one with the coastline, a sensory metronome gives rhythm to my soul and I am free to let my mind wander. I can become the ocean, my thoughts the water. I find this place so beautiful. I’ve needed this. I can’t think, I can’t breathe, I can’t feel; until I am able to drown myself in my thoughts. I am suffocating. My mind is on fire and I can’t pin down why. My hurricane was years ago, my life is better than it’s ever been, and yet, I feel so lost, so insecure.
                    <br> <br>
                *CRASH*
                    <br> <br>
                    <i>And in an instant, the waves knocked her down. Out cold. Unmoving. Unconscious. Underwater. Under her mind… </i>
                    <br> <br>
                Can I breathe breathe breathe breathe is there an echo in here where am I… I… I…am lost am I dreaming my fingertips weightless wait lessons learned I know nothing grey I can’t see I can’t feel where am I who am I existentialism is a coping mechanism insecurity ontology tragedy I miss him I can’t remember his voice echo echo echo… I can’t let go please don’t die is this the real life is this just fantasy please don’t be real none of this ever happened accept it am I delusional hospital bed not real cold hands blue not real soulless eyes regret not telling anyone I wish I could tell you I miss you did you exist I don’t exi—
                    <br> <br>
                *WHOOSH*
                    <br> <br>
                Oh. I can see it. Feel it. Like it was now. You’re there? In my mind? Lifeless. I am just trying to hug you. Screaming. I can’t process this.
                    <br> <br>
                Hours pass. Tick Tock. I watch the moments in the palliative ward tick in agony. Tick tock. Months pass. A new clock. A watch. I stare down at my wrist, heart pounding, ready to run for the first time in my life, drenched in a year’s worth of depression ever since… you… I still have a hard time saying it… even though it was… where am I? When am I? I bend down and lace up. One foot. Heavy. Two foot. Heavy.
                    <br> <br>
                Months pass. I think I remember this? Where am I? My 84th run. I ran that night, into the New Year. I needed that. I needed a fresh start. Why does it still hurt so much? I’m not there anymore. I miss you. Heavy. Intensity. Oh god, please not intensity. Flatline. Beeeeeeping piercing holes in what I thought was thick skin, until I am nothing but soundwaves. louder. Louder. LOUDER. It’s so heavy in my ear. I can’t hear my thoughts. It’s just too intense. I can… hear the ocean. Where is that coming from?
                    <br> <br>
                Hospital bed. Whoosh. Running. Crash. New Years. Whoosh. New Home. Crash.
                    <br> <br>
                    <i>Her thoughts consumed her as she lay cold in the sand. They washed over her. Zipping thoughts, jarring memories, her mind was drowning her. Everything she experienced led up to this moment and came crashing down on her. Intensity. </i>
                    <br> <br>
                Whoosh. This new place, full of magic and opportunity, how can I still feel pain? Crash. I’ve been through so much, I am finally free. Whoosh. But I still feel; if only I didn’t feel as deeply as I do. I wouldn’t have to feel pain. I just want to be happy. Whoosh. Crash.
                    <br> <br>
                *SILENCE*
                    <br> <br>
                Intensity wash over me. Let me feel pain. Let me be genuine. Your experience is valid. You are not a raindrop, you are a storm. You are not a puddle, you are the ocean. Nobody can tell you feeling is wrong. Whoosh. Crash. Intensity wash over me.
                    <br> <br>
                <i>Bliss. She is drenched. She awakens in the dampness. Her eyes open slowly. She breathes in intensity. Her thoughts rush through her. She is still.
