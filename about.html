                <h5>About the RaenyTuesday Media Portfolio</h5>
                <p><i>CHANGE THE WORLD IN THE WAY ONLY YOU CAN </i> <br> <br>
This thread runs through everything I do. The pieces included in this portfolio are artifacts of this manifesto. Everything I create is about curating my experiences, othersâ€™ perspectives, and information into projects that change the way people think. All centred around different forms of media, Nostalgia (creative non-fiction, music, and video), Curating Creativity (Podcast Script), and Adventures (Photography and Social Media) push the boundaries of each of their mediums. 
                    <br> <br>
Nostalgia, a piece about my brushes with tragedy and the intensity of nostalgia, plays on the medium and structure of words to create voices and immerse the audience in the emotion and the mind. Curating Creativity, a collaborative perspective on why we create, self-reflexively explores both interviewing as a medium and creativity as a human experience. Adventures, a photographic series, blurs the lines between creative projects and real experience, leading to a designed life. <br> <br>
Media is about systems of information, and those systems have an infinite amount of ways of constructing story and influencing and audience. I create because with everything I do, I can change a perspective, introduce new ideas, change the world with a little bit of creativity and inspiration. <br> <br>
Enjoy, let the works wash over you as you embark on this adventure into creative media. And I urge you, to change the world in the way only you can.
